# Decentralized Task Management dApp

A decentralized task management application that combines smart contracts with AI-powered prioritization.

## Project Overview

This project consists of three main parts:

- Smart Contract (`/contract`) - Task management logic on blockchain
- Backend Server (`/backend`) - NestJS server with auth and AI
- Frontend (`/frontend`) - React UI with wallet integration

## Quick Start

1. **Smart Contract**

   - Deploy contract to Sepolia network
   - Get contract address

2. **Backend Server**

   - Install dependencies and setup database
   - Configure environment variables
   - Start server

3. **Frontend**
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure contract address and backend URL
   - Start development server

## Main Features

- Create and manage tasks on blockchain
- Wallet authentication (MetaMask)
- AI-powered task prioritization
- Task status verification on blockchain

## Tech Stack

- Smart Contract: Solidity, Hardhat
- Backend: NestJS, Prisma, MySQL, Cohere AI
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ethers.js

## Detailed Setup

See individual README files in each directory for detailed setup instructions.
